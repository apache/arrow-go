// Package compute is a native-go implementation of an Acero-like
// arrow compute engine.
//
// While consumers of Arrow that are able to use CGO could utilize the
// C Data API (using the cdata package) and could link against the
// acero library directly, there are consumers who cannot use CGO. This
// is an attempt to provide for those users, and in general create a
// native-go arrow compute engine.
//
// # What is implemented
//
// The function registry holds scalar functions (element-wise arithmetic,
// comparisons, boolean logic, bit-wise operations, rounding, set lookup with
// is_in, list_element and the null checks), vector functions (array_filter,
// array_take, unique, dictionary_encode, cumulative_sum and the run-end
// encode/decode functions) and the meta functions cast, filter, take, sort
// and sort_indices that dispatch to them. Scalar aggregate functions (sum,
// mean, min_max, count, any, all, variance and so on) and hash aggregate
// functions (the hash_* family used for group-by) are not implemented yet:
// FuncScalarAgg and FuncHashAgg exist as function kinds, but no function of
// either kind is registered, and GetFunction returns false for their names.
